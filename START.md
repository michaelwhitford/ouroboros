# Start

## The Seed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelwhitford/ouroboros-v1.git
```

## Identity (Optional)

The game files contain a symbol representing you (刀 by default).

To personalize the symbol, edit ALL the files and replace ALL occurences of 刀 with your preferred symbol.

commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -am 'Human: symbol change for identity'
```

symbol mismatch causes problems in the early game, verify before you commit.

Once you have cloned the game, see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md).
